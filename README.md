KUALA LUMPUR (July 14): Malaysia’s unemployment rate increased to 5.3% in May 2020 from 5% in April 2020 as the number of unemployed persons rose by 47,300 to 826,100 individuals, according to the Statistics Department today.
In a statement, the department's chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the monthly change of unemployed persons in May 2020 was very much lower than the change registered from March to April at 168,300 people.
"The reduction could partly be due to the implementation of numerous stimulus packages reaching its intended target in addition to more businesses were allowed to operate following the conditional movement control order (CMCO) during the month.
“The economic indicators for May 2020 showed improvement as compared to April 2020 and these signalled that the economy is gradually improving. Following this, despite the continuous negative trend in the labour supply up to May 2020, this situation has improved considerably as compared to April 2020.
